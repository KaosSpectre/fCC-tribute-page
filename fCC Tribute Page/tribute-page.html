				<ul id="timeline"></ul>
				<li>
					<strong>10 December 1815</strong> - The birth of Augusta Ada Byron.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>1823</strong> - Ada suffered from headaches that obscure her
					vision.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>1828</strong> - Ada, known as the "fairy lady" by Charles
					Burbage, decides that she wants to fly. She contructs wings from many
					different materials, and studies the anatomy of birds in order to
					better determine the ratio of wing to body.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>1829</strong> - Ada contracts the Measles. She is bedridden
					for nearly a year.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>1832</strong> - Ada's mathematical abilities begin to emerge.
					She was privately educated by William Frend, William King, Mary
					Somerville and Augustus De Morgan. De Morgan taught her much,
					including the "numbers of
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_number">Bernoulli</a
					>" which formed the algorithim for which she became known as The
					Mother of Coding.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>1833</strong> - Ada is introduced to Charles Burbage by Mary
					Somerville, who was Ada's tutor and friend. He showed her his
					prototype "Difference Engine" and she was fascinated. Burbage was in
					turn impressed with Ada's intellect and analytical skills. He dubbed
					her the "Enchantress of Numbers".
				</li>
				<li><strong>8 July 1835</strong> - Ada married William King.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>1836-1839</strong> - Ada has three children, Byron(1836), Anne
					Issabelle(1837) and Ralph Gordon(1839)
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>9 Months in 1842-1843</strong> - Ada appended a set of notes
					with the article written by Luigi Menabrea. In them, she explained the
					function of the Analytical Engine and her work was very well recieved.
					The notes were 3 times longer than the article and included the "Note
					G". In which she showed a method for calculating a set of
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_number">Bernoulli</a>
					numbers. This work has caused her to be regarded by many as the first
					computer programmer.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>27 November 1852</strong> - Ada, age of 36, dies of uterine
					cancer after several months. She is buried next to her father at her
					request.
